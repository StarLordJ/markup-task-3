                            to&nbsp;still vote for Mr. Obama, even though the mother feared that
                            winning would put him in&nbsp;danger. And at&nbsp;a&nbsp;rally here,
                            a&nbsp;woman expressed worries that a&nbsp;message of&nbsp;hope and
                            change, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;his race, made him more vulnerable
                            to&nbsp;violence.</p>
                        <p>&laquo;I&rsquo;ve got the best protection in&nbsp;the world,&raquo; Mr.
                            Obama, of&nbsp;Illinois, said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, reprising
                            a&nbsp;line he&nbsp;tells supporters who raise the issue with him.
                            &laquo;So&nbsp;stop worrying.&raquo;</p>
                        <p>Yet worry they&nbsp;do, with the spring of&nbsp;1968 seared into their
                            memories, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King&nbsp;Jr. and Senator
                            Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;span of&nbsp;two
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Obama was 6&nbsp;at the time, and like many of&nbsp;his admirers,
                            he&nbsp;has only read about the violence that traumatized the nation.
                            But those recollections and images are often invoked by&nbsp;older
                            voters, who watch his candidacy with fascination, as&nbsp;well
                            as&nbsp;an&nbsp;uneasy air of&nbsp;apprehension, as&nbsp;Democrats inch
                            closer to&nbsp;selecting their nominee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Obama has had Secret Service agents surrounding him since
                            May&nbsp;3, the earliest a&nbsp;candidate has ever been provided
                            protection. (He&nbsp;reluctantly gave in&nbsp;to&nbsp;the insistent
                            urging of&nbsp;Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of&nbsp;Illinois,
                            and others in&nbsp;Congress.) As&nbsp;his rallies have swelled
                            in&nbsp;size, his security has increased, coming close to&nbsp;rivaling
                            that given to&nbsp;a&nbsp;sitting president.</p>
                        <p>His wife, Michelle Obama, voiced concerns about his safety before
                            he&nbsp;was elected to&nbsp;the Senate. Three years ago, she said she
                            dreaded the day her husband received Secret Service protection, because
                            it&nbsp;would mean serious threats had been made against him.</p>
                        <p>Among friends and advisers, danger is&nbsp;something Mr. Obama rarely
                            mentions.</p>
                        <p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;m spending time thinking
                            about day to&nbsp;day</p>

                            on&nbsp;Judges</h2>
                        <span class="author">By&nbsp;CARL HULSE</span>

                        <p>WASHINGTON&nbsp;&mdash; Back in&nbsp;2005, Senator John McCain
                            of&nbsp;Arizona and fellow members of&nbsp;the so-called Gang
                            of&nbsp;14&nbsp;were hailed as&nbsp;heroes in&nbsp;some quarters when
                            they fashioned an&nbsp;unusual pact that averted a&nbsp;Senate vote
                            on&nbsp;banning filibusters against judicial nominees.</p>
                        <p>Now Mr. McCain&rsquo;s central role in&nbsp;that effort, which cleared
                            the way for confirmation of&nbsp;some conservative jurists,
                            is&nbsp;cited as&nbsp;one reason for lingering distrust of&nbsp;him
                            among many conservatives. The power to&nbsp;appoint federal judges
                            is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most crucial presidential roles
                            by&nbsp;many on&nbsp;the right, and some continue to&nbsp;believe the
                            agreement undermined the Republican leadership at&nbsp;the precise
                            moment the party was about to&nbsp;eliminate the ability to&nbsp;use
                            procedural tactics to&nbsp;block judges.</p>
                        <p>James C. Dobson, an&nbsp;influential conservative leader, noted Mr.
                            McCain&rsquo;s role in&nbsp;the bipartisan Gang
                            of&nbsp;14&nbsp;in&nbsp;his announcement that he&nbsp;could not support
                            the lawmaker as&nbsp;the Republican nominee under any circumstances.
                            Other conservatives still resent it&nbsp;as&nbsp;well.</p>
                        <p>&laquo;When people hear he&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;the Gang of&nbsp;14,
                            it&nbsp;leaves a&nbsp;bad taste in&nbsp;their mouths,&raquo; said Phil
                            Burress, president of&nbsp;the Citizens for Community Values, based
                            in&nbsp;Ohio.</p>
                        <p>Even some colleagues now backing Mr. McCain consider the judicial
                            agreement a&nbsp;sore subject. &laquo;We&nbsp;had the votes to&nbsp;put
                            both parties on&nbsp;the spot that whoever is&nbsp;president,
                            Republican or&nbsp;Democrat, has a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;appoint and
                            we&nbsp;have the right to&nbsp;vote up&nbsp;or&nbsp;down,&raquo; said
                            Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of&nbsp;Utah and a&nbsp;former

                        <p>DETROIT&nbsp;&mdash; For generations, driver&rsquo;s licenses have been
                            tickets to&nbsp;freedom for America&rsquo;s 16-year-olds, prompting
                            many to&nbsp;line up&nbsp;at&nbsp;motor vehicle offices the day they
                            were eligible to&nbsp;apply.</p>
                        <p>No&nbsp;longer. In&nbsp;the last decade, the proportion
                            of&nbsp;16-year-olds nationwide who hold driver&rsquo;s licenses has
                            dropped from nearly half to&nbsp;less than one-third, according
                            to&nbsp;statistics from the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
                        <p>Reasons vary, including tighter state laws governing when teenagers can
                            drive, higher insurance costs and a&nbsp;shift from school-run driver
                            education to&nbsp;expensive private driving academies.</p>
                        <p>To&nbsp;that mix, experts also add parents who are willing
                            to&nbsp;chauffeur their children to&nbsp;activities, and pastimes like
                            surfing the Web that keep them indoors and glued to&nbsp;computers.</p>
                        <p>Jaclyn Frederick, 17, of&nbsp;suburban Detroit, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;year past
                            the age when she could get a&nbsp;Michigan license. She said she
                            planned to&nbsp;apply for one eventually, but sees no&nbsp;rush.</p>
                        <p>&laquo;Oh, I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I just haven&rsquo;t done it&nbsp;yet, you
                            know?&raquo; said Jaclyn, a&nbsp;senior at&nbsp;Ferndale High School,
                            in&nbsp;Ferndale, Mich.</p>
                        <p>&laquo;I&nbsp;get rides and stuff, so&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not worried
                            about&nbsp;it. I&rsquo;ll get around to&nbsp;it, maybe this summer
                            sometime.&raquo;</p>
                        <p>Until she does, she has company. The national rate of&nbsp;licensed
                            16-year-olds dropped to&nbsp;29.8 percent in&nbsp;2006 from 43.8
                            percent in&nbsp;1998, according to&nbsp;the Federal Highway
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>The falling rate of&nbsp;teenage drivers is&nbsp;perplexing
                            to&nbsp;Michael T. Marsden, an&nbsp;expert on&nbsp;car culture and dean
                            of&nbsp;St. Norbert College in&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pere, Wis.</p>
                        <p>&laquo;It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;big change in&nbsp;a&nbsp;major American ritual

                        <p>DUBLIN&nbsp;&mdash; Cork-born and proud of&nbsp;it, George-Jordan Dimbo
                            is&nbsp;top to&nbsp;toe the Irish lad. He&nbsp;studies Gaelic, eats
                            rashers, plays hurling, prays to&nbsp;the saints, papers his walls with
                            parochial school awards, and spends Saturdays at&nbsp;the telly

                            powerful.</p>
                        <p>If&nbsp;the Irish government has its way, he&nbsp;may soon
                            be&nbsp;living in&nbsp;Africa.</p>
                        <p>George, 11, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;Irish citizen and has been since his birth
                            when Ireland, alone in&nbsp;Europe, still gave citizenship
                            to&nbsp;anyone born on&nbsp;its soil. His mother and father, Ifedinma
                            and Ethelbert Dimbo, are illegal immigrants from Nigeria, who brought
                            him back to&nbsp;Ireland three years ago, judging it&nbsp;the best
                            place to&nbsp;raise him.</p>
                        <p>Since then, the unusual trio&nbsp;&mdash; the Irish schoolboy and his
                            African parents&nbsp;&mdash; have shared a&nbsp;single room
                            in&nbsp;a&nbsp;worn Dublin hostel while facing a&nbsp;prospect dreaded
                            by&nbsp;children on&nbsp;both sides of&nbsp;the Atlantic,
                            a&nbsp;parent&rsquo;s deportation.</p>
                        <p>&laquo;Dear justice minister,&raquo; George wrote when he&nbsp;was 9.
                            &laquo;I&nbsp;heard my&nbsp;Mommy and Daddy whispering about
                            deportation. Please do&nbsp;not deport&nbsp;us.&raquo;</p>
                        <p>&laquo;Remember,&raquo; he&nbsp;added, &laquo;I&nbsp;am also
                            an&nbsp;Irish child.&raquo;</p>
                        <p>Thousands of&nbsp;Irish children face similar risks, living
                            in&nbsp;a&nbsp;country where one or&nbsp;both parents do&nbsp;not
                            legally reside. Their stories find abundant parallels in&nbsp;the
                            United States, where an&nbsp;estimated five million
                            children&nbsp;&mdash; including three million American
                            citizens&nbsp;&mdash; have parents who are illegal immigrants. New
                            efforts to&nbsp;catch them make fear of&nbsp;deportation a&nbsp;growing
                            factor in&nbsp;American life, the flip side of&nbsp;generous laws that
                            make infants instant citizens.</p>
                        <p>The battle over the &laquo;I.B.C.&rsquo;s&raquo;&nbsp;&mdash; Irish-born
                            children&nbsp;&mdash; stems from a&nbsp;decade of&nbsp;head-turning
                            change that has brought this island of&nbsp;red-haired Marys and
                            blue-eyed Seans the demographic version of&nbsp;an&nbsp;extreme
                            makeover.</p>
                        <p>For centuries, Ireland was a&nbsp;racially homogenous land
                            of&nbsp;emigrants. Now it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;multicultural nation
                            of&nbsp;immigrants, whose share of&nbsp;the population,
                            11&nbsp;percent, is&nbsp;nearly as&nbsp;high as&nbsp;that in&nbsp;the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Years of&nbsp;Irish prosperity have drawn Polish plumbers, Lithuanian
                            nannies, Latvian farm workers, Filipino nurses, Chinese traders, and
                            sub-Saharan asylum seekers. The town of&nbsp;Portlaoise, about
                            40&nbsp;miles southwest of&nbsp;Dublin, has the country&rsquo;s first
                            African-born mayor. The Synge Street School, where George Dimbo says
                            his Hail Marys beneath a&nbsp;plaster Virgin, is&nbsp;walking distance
                            from the city&rsquo;s first mosque and rents classroom space
                            to&nbsp;two Chinese academies.</p>

                            <p>Some readers called it&nbsp;blatant propaganda from the West.
                                Others viewed it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;depressing expose that rang

                        <p>AMMAN, Jordan&nbsp;&mdash; Even as&nbsp;it&nbsp;enriches Arab rulers,
                            the recent oil-price boom is&nbsp;helping to&nbsp;fuel
                            an&nbsp;extraordinary rise in&nbsp;the cost of&nbsp;food and other
                            basic goods that is&nbsp;squeezing this region&rsquo;s middle class and
                            setting off strikes, demonstrations and occasional riots from Morocco
                            to&nbsp;the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Here in&nbsp;Jordan, the cost of&nbsp;maintaining fuel subsidies amid
                            the surge in&nbsp;prices forced the government to&nbsp;remove almost
                            all the subsidies this month, sending the price of&nbsp;some fuels
                            up&nbsp;76&nbsp;percent overnight. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;devastating domino
                            effect, the cost of&nbsp;basic foods like eggs, potatoes and cucumbers
                            doubled or&nbsp;more.</p>
                        <p>In&nbsp;Saudi Arabia, where inflation had been virtually zero for
                            a&nbsp;decade, it&nbsp;recently reached an&nbsp;official level
                            of&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;percent, though unofficial estimates put it&nbsp;much
                            higher. Public protests and boycotts have followed, and
                            19&nbsp;prominent clerics posted an&nbsp;unusual statement on&nbsp;the
                            Internet in&nbsp;December warning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;crisis that would
                            cause &laquo;theft, cheating, armed robbery and resentment between rich
                            and poor.&raquo;</p>
                        <p>The&nbsp;inflation has many causes, from rising global demand for
                            commodities to&nbsp;the monetary constraints of&nbsp;currencies pegged
                            to&nbsp;the weakening American dollar. But one cause is&nbsp;the
                            skyrocketing price of&nbsp;oil itself, which has quadrupled since 2002.
                            It&nbsp;is&nbsp;helping push many ordinary people toward poverty even
                            as&nbsp;it&nbsp;stimulates a&nbsp;new surge of&nbsp;economic growth
                            in&nbsp;the gulf.</p>
                        <p>&laquo;Now we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;choose: we&nbsp;either eat or&nbsp;stay
                            warm. We&nbsp;can&rsquo;t do&nbsp;both,&raquo; said Abdul Rahman Abdul
                            Raheem, who works at&nbsp;a&nbsp;clothing shop in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mall
                            in&nbsp;Amman and once dreamed of&nbsp;sending his children
                            to&nbsp;private school. &laquo;We&rsquo;re not really middle class
                            anymore; we&rsquo;re at&nbsp;the poverty level.&raquo;</p>
                        <p>Some governments have tried to&nbsp;soften the impact of&nbsp;high
                            prices by&nbsp;increasing wages or&nbsp;subsidies on&nbsp;foods.
                            Jordan, for instance, has raised the wages of&nbsp;public-sector
                            employees earning less than 300 dinars ($423) a&nbsp;month
                            by&nbsp;50&nbsp;dinars ($70). For those earning more than
                            300&nbsp;dinars, the raise was 45&nbsp;dinars, or&nbsp;$64. But that
                            compensates for only a&nbsp;fraction of&nbsp;the price increases, and
                            most people who work&nbsp;in</p>

                            afraid of&nbsp;losing custody of&nbsp;her children called the police
                            on&nbsp;Sunday and led officers into a&nbsp;blood-spattered bedroom
                            where her young daughter and two small sons lay slain
                            on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bed, investigators said.</p>
                        <p>The woman, Leatrice Brewer, 27, who lived with the children
                            in&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment in&nbsp;the Nassau County hamlet of&nbsp;New

                            examinations, the police said. Late Sunday evening, she was charged
                            with the murder of&nbsp;all three children.</p>
                        <p>Neither the police nor the county medical examiner said what caused the
                            death of&nbsp;the children, who were identified as&nbsp;Jewell Ward, 6;
                            Michael Demesyeux, 5; and Innocent Demesyeux, 18&nbsp;months old. But
