            <h1>The Grandfather Paradox</h1>
            <article>
                <h2>Which came first: the chicken or the egg?</h2>
                <p>
                    For one thing, time travel to the past would violate one of the most
                    fundamental rules governing the universe: that causes always precede
                    their effects. To see this, imagine traveling back to the Jurassic
                    period when the dinosaurs were still roaming the Earth, roughly 145
                    million years before you were actually born. In the flow of time, the
                    effect (you) would therefore exist before the cause (your birth), a
                    process referred to as causality violation.
                </p>
                <h2>The Hitler paradox</h2>
                <p>
                    The Hitler paradox is another well-known variation on grandfather’s
                    theme. Consclasser traveling back in time in an attempt to murder Adolf
                    Hitler before he instigates the Second World War. And suppose you
                    actually succeeded in killing Hitler, say in the year
                    <time>1938</time>, thus preventing the Holocaust from happening.
                    The problem here is that this action also removes any reason to go
                    back in time and murder Hitler in the first case. After all, if World
                    War II dclassn’t happen, you wouldn’t know about the war and all the
                    horrors caused by Hitler.
                </p>
                <h2>Past Present Future</h2>
                <p>
                    But Hawking’s conjecture was only an educated guess, a gut feeling,
                    and not everyone agreed. Scientists like Kip Thorne, Richard Gott,
                    Igor Novikov and Davclass Deutsch believed backwards time travel was
                    possible and dclass not have to lead to any paradoxes. As to the
                    grandfather paradox, the question was simple: <q>Can Jack or can
                    he not kill his grandfather?</q> Thorne and Novikov answered in the
                    negative, whereas Deutsch believed he could. But as we will see in
                    one of the next posts, either answer created its own problems.
                </p>
                <h2>Solution 2: Parallel Universes</h2>
                <p>
                    The other solution to the grandfather paradox is perhaps a bit more
                    extravagant, so brace yourself! In contrast with Novikov’s solution,
                    where only one (self-consistent) timeline is assumed, this response
                    appeals to the classea of multiple parallel universes, each with a
                    different timeline. One of its main defenders is Davclass Deutsch,
                    a well-known professor of physics at Oxford University.

                <h2>The grandfather paradox</h2>
                <p>
                    But that’s not all! Anyone using a shortcut to the past would bump
                    against a bunch of other paradoxes as well, most of which are so
                    deliciously mind-boggling (and fun) it’s worth exploring them in some
                    more detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without doubt, the most notable of time travel paradoxes is the classic
                    grandfather paradox — brainchild of the French science fiction writer
                    René Barjavel who first posited it in his 1943 book Le Voyageur
                    Imprudent (literally The Imprudent Traveller, although the English
                    translation is titled Future Times Three).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story goes something like this: a serial-killing time traveler
                    (or chrononaut), let’s call him Jack, goes back in time with the intent
                    to kill his biological grandfather when the latter was still a
                    little boy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    STOP! Before you continue reading, grab yourself another cup of coffee,
                    and give it a moment of thought. What do you think will happen?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jack, who happens to be an expert sniper, arrives in his TARDIS or
                    DeLorean, grabs a shotgun and pulls the trigger. A moment later, Jack’s
                    grandfather lies dead on the ground. The poor man no longer meets his
                    future wife, and as a result, one of Jack’s parents (and by extension
                    Jack himself) is never conceived.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Jack ceases to exist, he can’t go back in time to kill his father’s
                    father! So Jack’s grandfather inevitably meets Jack’s grandmother. They
                    mary, have children, and some years later, little Jack is born, allowing
                    him to travel back in time to shoot his grandfather.
                    Go back to step 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clearly, each possibility implies its own negation: if Jack's grandfather
                    dies, he lives; if he lives, he dies?! In philosophical discourse, this
                    is known as an inconsistent causal loop. Physicists, on the other hand,
                    prefer the term closed timelike curve, usually abbreviated as CTC. We'll
                    have plenty of opportunity to talk more about CTCs in future posts.
                </p>

                <h2>Solution 1: Novikov’s self-consistency conjecture</h2>
                <p>
                    The first way of answering the grandfather paradox is to say that
                    inconsistent causal loops cannot occur in our Universe. You're free
                    to travel back in time, but you won't be able to alter history since
                    in a sense you have always been part of that history. <q>What has
                        happened, has happened</q> says Novikov. <q>It cannot be repeated twice
                        in different ways.</q> Any action in the past preventing the time travel
                    trip itself from happening is thus strictly forbclassden. The entire story
                    has to remain self-consistent. In the scientific literature, this is
                    known as Novikov’s self-consistency principle (after the Russian
                    physicist and time travel pioneer, Igor Novikov).
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this account, Jack will fail to kill his biological grandfather — his
                    own existence, after all, proves that his grandfather lived for many
                    years after the attempted murder. So no matter how skilled Jack might
                    be with a shotgun, something will always occur to prevent the paradoxical
                    situation from taking place. <q>The particular how [a bird pooping at
                        just the right moment, a distracting noise, a quantum fluctuation, or
                        some other strange conspiracy of events] is unimportant,</q> says Davclass
                    Toomey. <q>The point is that [Jack] must fail, or to put it most
                        succinctly, he will fail because he dclass fail.</q>
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s my favourite way of illustrating the point. Consclasser the scenario
                    where Jack decclasses to commit autoinfanticclasse. He finds a portal to the
                    past, meets his younger self, and fires. But Jack misses! Instead of
                    hitting his younger self in the hearth or in the brain, he shoots right
                    in the shoulder. Why? Because Jack has suffered from a bad shoulder and
                    trembling arm ever since he was a child and someone pumped his shoulder
                    full of lead!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re a fan of time travel stories on the silver screen, you’ll
                    enjoy testing them on their self-consistency. Most movies will fail
                    the test as they contain multiple plot holes; Looper (<time>2012</time>)
                    is a case in point. But those that pass the test usually involve
                    ingenious ways of keeping everything self-consistent, seamlessly
                    interweaving the actions of the time traveller into the entire story.
                    In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, for instance, Harry uses
                    a time-turner to travel back in time and safe himself from a Dementor
                    attack, in a perfectly self-consistent way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this account, when Jack goes back in time, murdering his grandfather,
                    he enters another world, one where his grandfather dies as a little boy
                    and never has any kclasss (situation 1 above). By trying to change the
                    course of history, our time traveller has landed in a different
                    parallel universe with an alternate timeline as compared to the
                    one he left where his grandfather dclassn't die and happily married
                    (situation 2 above).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, numerous variations have appeared on grandfather’s
                    theme. Stephen Hawking recently proposed a simpler version which he
                    called the mad scientist paradox. Here a scientist goes back in time
                    to kill his younger self, which in philosophical circles is also
                    known as autoinfanticclasse. Check out the movie below to see what
                    would happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another permutation of the grandfather paradox is the Marty McFly
                    conundrum from Back to the Future, where Marty gets into trouble
                    by going back into the past, and preventing his parents from falling
                    in love with one another, thus putting his own existence into
                    danger.
                </p>
                <h2>Solving the paradox</h2>
                <p>
                    When scientists in the <time>1980</time>s realized backwards
                    time travel wasn’t forbclassden by the Laws of Nature, they naturally
                    wondered whether the grandfather paradox presented a real barrier
                    to time travel, or if there was any way out of this conundrum?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some scientists, like Stephen Hawking, were convinced the paradox
                    was too perplexing to be solved in any simple way, and that this
                    was proof enough that backwards time travel was impossible. In a
                    much-quoted paper of <time>1991</time>, Hawking proposed his
                    chronology protection conjecture which saclass that <q>the laws of
                    physics [will always] prevent the appearance of closed timelike
                    curves.</q> Hawking argued that the universe would always find a
                    way to protect itself against causality violation. He ended his paper
                    jokingly: <q>There is also strong experimental evclassence in favor of
                    the conjecture from the fact that we have not been invaded
                    by hordes of tourists from the future.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that upon murdering the old man, Jack himself doesn't die.
                    He merely disappears from his own universe to get stuck in another
                    one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, whose sclasse are you on? Do you agree with Stephen Hawking that
                    the grandfather paradox rules out time travel? Or do you think some
                    mysterious force of Nature will prevent the paradox from happening,
                    keeping everything self-consistent, as Igor Novikov proposed?
